Here's an equation:

\[ M^\bot = \{ f \in V' : f(m) = 0 \mbox{ for all } m \in M \}.\]

Here's d2u/dx2 : (use the dollar sign before and after math stuff)

$ \frac{d^2 u}{dx^2} $


Here's another equation:

\[ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{3x^2 +7x^3}{x^2 +5x^4} = 3.\]

Here's a summation:
\[ \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{1}{2} n (n+1).\] 

and an integral:
\[ \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.\]

Here are some Greek letters:
$ \Delta \Psi \Phi $
and some lower case ones:
$ \delta \psi \phi \omega \pi \sigma \mu $.
